// Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13

// Print the result of 13 added to 22

// Print the result of 13 substracted from 22

// Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13

// Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)

// Print the remainder of 22 divided by 13

let a = 22;
let b = 13;

console.log(b+a);
console.log(a-b);
console.log(a*b);
console.log(a%b);
